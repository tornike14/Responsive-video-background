- Video content is an engaging way to tell a story or deliver a message to your supporters.
  By adding videos to your page content, you can convey helpful and heartfelt information in a different and easy-to-consume way,
  so i thought that it would be useful for you to use on your website.

- Of course, there are many way to scale video on full screen, read the comments in the code and make your own choices. good luck !
